    fullDescription:
      "Navratri, meaning nine nights, is a grand Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of Goddess Durga and her nine forms. Celebrated twice a year — in Chaitra (spring) and Sharad (autumn) seasons — Sharad Navratri holds the most significance. Each day is devoted to a different form of the Goddess, symbolizing various aspects like strength, knowledge, prosperity, and devotion. People observe fasting, perform special pujas, and engage in traditional dances like Garba and Dandiya Raas, especially in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Homes and temples are adorned beautifully, and cultural programs fill the air with festive energy. Navratri is not just a religious event but also a spiritual journey where devotees seek inner cleansing, strength, and the victory of good over evil, culminating in the celebration of Vijayadashami or Dussehra on the tenth day.",
